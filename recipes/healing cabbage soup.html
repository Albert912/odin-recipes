<p>My body craves this cabbage soup whenever I have a cold, but it's equally delicious on a cold winter's night. It's so easy to make; add extra vegetables, leftover chicken, or rice for a more substantial meal.</p>

<p>Whether you're feeling under the weather or you're just in the mood for a bowlful of comfort, warm up with this cozy cabbage soup recipe. It's easy, tasty, and incredibly customizable (so you can keep it simple or get as creative as you want).</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
  <li>2 quarts water</li>
  <li>4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, or to taste</li>
  <li>½ head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped</li>
  <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, drained and diced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Step 1</b></li>
  <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</p>
  <li><b>Step 2</b></li>
  <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add water and taco seasoning; cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
  <li><b>Step 3 </b></li>
  <p>Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish; spread about half the can of refried beans and half the ground beef atop the tortilla layer. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over ground beef layer. Arrange 3 more tortillas over the cheese. Spread in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce; sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese. Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese. Top with last 3 tortillas and remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.</p>
  <li><b>Step 4</b></li>
  <p>Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.</p>
  <li><b>Step 5</b></li>
  <p>Turn on oven's broiler.</p>
  <li><b>Step 6</b></li>
  <p>Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack cheese is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
